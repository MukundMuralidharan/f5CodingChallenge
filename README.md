Project is creating using 3 class files
baseclass
contantfiles
assertTestCases

Baseclass :
  class is used to setup and teardown the test case.

ConstantFile:
Any constant values are placed in the contantFile class.
    here in this project url and punisher url are placed in constantfile.
    
AssertTestCases:
  Both the cases
    Test 1:
      Assert that the dynamic text (the lorem ipsum text block) on the page contains a word at least 10 characters in length.
    Stretch goal:
      Print the longest word on the page.
  
   Test 2:
    Assert that the "Punisher" image (silhouette with a skull on his chest) does not appear on the page.  This test may pass or fail on any given execution depending on whether the punisher happens to be on the page.
